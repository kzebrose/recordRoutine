HOW TO UPDATE
1) add new data to *.dat files
   a) if multiple runs, usually 2, add them all to *Detail.dat files
   b) calculate the average and add this one value to *.dat
2) run pltAll.sh to create new graphs
3) use eog to view graphs

TODO
currently multiple data points from the same day can be graphed
the average is not plotted

NOTE
In this directory *.plt are temporary files.
The source files are *.template files.
Look at pltAll.sh  to understand.

SEE ~/myExamples/gnuplot for training info

gnuplot is a good way to plot data
input data format is columns of data with whitespace separating the data
gnuplot "file.plt"
<example below>
  set terminal png size 800,800 enhanced font "Helvetica,20";
  set output "exHis.png";
  set title 'Kate Zebrose Average Dist Miles in 5 minutes';
  set ytics font "Helvetica,10";
  set xtics font "Helvetica,10";
  plot 'exHis.dat' notitle with linespoints;
